# Scope

**A3 Mass Shootings / Firearms by GDP Comparrisons**
* Data cleaning/ merging exerxise 
* Generate the comparisons, featuring USA and without, plus error bars
  - Plot mass shooting vs gdp in absolute numbers, and per person
  - Find the average number of civilian fire arms per person + the average number of homicide by firearm per person
* Model
 - Mass shooting as a function of civilian firearms with and w/o USA (see below)

**A1 Z Test**
* Create a random poisson distribution
* Plot the z scores 
* Plot a gaussian best fit line, and fit line of z stats dist to see how they 

**A2 Goodness of Fit**
* Interpret what each test means for the examples given
* Create arrays of key parameters for both binomial and poisson dists
* Plot statistics and p values as mean increases, to show how they relate as they change
* Add captions explaining relationships
