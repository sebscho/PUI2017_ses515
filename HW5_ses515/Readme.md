* Create a random poisson distribution
* Plot the z scores 
* Plot a gaussian best fit line, and fit line of z stats dist to see how they 

**A2 Goodness of Fit**
* Interpret what each test means for the examples given
* Create arrays of key parameters for both binomial and poisson dists
* Plot statistics and p values as mean increases, to show how they relate as they change

**A3 Mass Shootings / Firearms**
* Data cleaning/ merging exerxise 
* Generate the comparisons, featuring USA and without

* 2 - Worked with matt primarily, and then finished during office hours with vivian and valeria. jack shared the thinking behind how to do the chi square test, which i had trouble plotting. 
* 3 - Worked primarily with Matt and Matt, with some syntax corrections by Juan.
