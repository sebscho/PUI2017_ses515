## Collaboration

I was largely along for the ride this week, and learned something from everyone I spoke to this week: from Rebecca who caught that I was working in the wrong kernel, to Prince and Professor Bianco, who helped me with my environmental variables, to Christian who helped me format my csv output. I was initially in a slack group with: Charlie, Jack, Prince, and Dana, where we determined how to uses argr(sys). Over the weekend, I worked with Prince and Dana, to finalize our first two scripts. Dana and I worked together on the third assignment, to use pandas to read from the csv.

Primary collaborators: Dana, Prince - troubleshooting first two scripts while I couldn't access Jupyter


## Notes

For most of the weekend I was unable to access Jupytr hub from compute. Instead, I used anaconda to work from my local machine, pushed to github, and pulled down on compute from there. The inconsistencies with the data facility were particularly trying this week. 

When trying to set my default text editor, I messed up my bash_profile. I spent much of my time trying to reset environmental variables and alises before I could move forward. Lesson learned.
