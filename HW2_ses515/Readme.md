## Notes

For most of the weekend I was unable to access Jupytr hub from compute. Instead, I used anaconda to work from my local machine, pushed to github, and pulled down on compute from there. The inconsistencies with the data facility were particularly trying this week. 

When trying to set my default text editor, I messed up my bash_profile. I spent much of my time trying to reset environmental variables and alises before I could move forward. Lesson learned.
