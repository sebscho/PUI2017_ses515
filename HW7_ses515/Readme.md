## Authora report
Worked on this report alone, incorporating feedback of my two peer reviewers, Colin and Praveen. A link to the report [can be found at this link](https://www.authorea.com/210933/nDrTzAl5ZU_Mpp5_c9ICnQ) (which includes the embedded notebook), and a pdf version has been uploaded to the repo.

## Citibike notebook update
This is a continuation of HW3 CitiBike analysis, which is expanded to include statistical tests and peer review feedback. 

## SQL Lab
This notebook contains the queries used in the SQL Lab with Professor Vo. This also includes a link to the Carto map with the cumulative, complete assignment we built together in class.
