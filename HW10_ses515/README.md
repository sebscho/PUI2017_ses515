This assignment works with timeseries data to understand subway ridership trends over time. The questions and plots work with event detection, staionariy, and fourier tranformations. 

I worked primarily on my own this week, with support from Matt S and other part-timers. Matt provided the idea to look at one year on its own to monitor periodicity, and how to think about problem two. I also recieved help from Rebecca, who helped with the for loop for number two to plot swipes by ridership type.  

Note: I used my extension for the assignment this week.
