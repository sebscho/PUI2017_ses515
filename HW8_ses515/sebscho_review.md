Hey Sarah,

The choice of plot was good and it was easy to understand the information you were trying to portray. You've already made several references to some of the changes you could make and I agree with them.  but rearranging it so in the order of green, yellow, then red would be best. Outside of that I believe your data represents your dataset very well.
