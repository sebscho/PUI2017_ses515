![Tree Health 2015 by Borough](https://github.com/sebscho/PUI2017_ses515/blob/master/HW8_ses515/tree_health.png)
**Fig 1:** This image shows the count of trees in "Poor," "Average," and "Good" health in New York City's five boroughs, acoording to the 2015 Tree Census. From this chart, you can compare the number of total trees in each borough, and the health breakdown by color.

I know there's room for improvement here. Things I want to play with include:
* Stacking bars in a new order: "Good", then "Fair", then "Poor"
* Making the legend larger
* Experiment more with color

# Collaboration
I worked on this visualization alone primarily, with a plt.grid hint from Rebecca.
