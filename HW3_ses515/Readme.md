## Central Limit Theorem Proof
Plotting random distirbutions' means (normal, poisson, chi-squared, binomial, exponential) to prove the Central Limit Theorem - as the sample size gets larger, the variation in the mean gets smaller, getting closer to the population's true mean.

randint scatter plots and histograms.

## HW3_2
Exploratory analysis using citibike data: finding citibike trip duration by gender (July 2016)

### Question: 
Is the average trip time for citibike affected by the gender of the person?

### Null hypothesis:

Using the 2017 July Citibike dataset, the average trip time taken by female is the same as the time taken by men.

M = average trip time for male riders in July 2017 <br />
F = average trip time for gender riders in July 2017

$H_0$: F = M

### Alternative hypothesis
The average triptime of a citibike trip during July 2017 is significantly (at a 95% confidence level) different depending on the user's gender(two tail test).

M = average trip time for male riders in July 2017 <br />
F = average trip time for gender riders in July 2017

$H_1$: $F \neq M$
