Hi Sarah,

I have gone through your work on Citibike Assignment. Firstly, I would like to commend your efforts on it because you have done the analysis on different lines than the ones demonstrated by Federcia. I tried to derive a similar correlation between Average Trip Duration and Age Group, but was unsuccesful and then went ahead to derive a different relationship.

The problem statement that you have Considered - "Is the average trip time for citibike affected by the gender of the person?" can be answered by utilizing the citibike dataset as we have both the attributes Gender and Trip Duration & the data for both the columns (Gender & Trip Duration) is complete without any missing values.

The Null hypothesis formulated that "The average trip time taken by female is the same as the time taken by men" 

The average trip duration for Men : 758 Seconds and Std. Deviation: 571

The average trip duration for Women : 758 Seconds and Std. Deviation: 617

It is noted that the Significance level has not been indicated in the notebook. You could specify a significance level of 0.05.

Since you try to identify if there exists a difference between two groups, i.e. the trip duration taken by men and tri duration taken by women, it would be best suited to go for Chi-Squared test.

Best,
Praveen
