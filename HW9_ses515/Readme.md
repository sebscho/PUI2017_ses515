# Scope
This assignments uses Shapely and Geopandas to look at the distribution of LinkNYC Wifi Hubs. It uses data from both the American Community Survey and NYC Open Data to compare where the hubs are spatially, in relation to who has access to broadband internet access. 

# Collaboration
I worked primarily with Matt S. and Alex S. on this assignment. Code from [GeopandasABCs](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2017_fb55/blob/master/HW9_fb55/pandasGeospatialABC.ipynb) notebook was reporposed as we plotted. Matt was particularly helpful with merging large datasets.
