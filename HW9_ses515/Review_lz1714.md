## Review: 

What a visually striking, and beautiful visualization! The graph is clear, and visually tells a story. Before even reading the caption, I could tell that these were trips to the airport, especially because of the large white dot at JFK's location. The colors in the visualization help to tell the story because they're the color of taxis. The grid lines help to provide scale, and the clusters of origin locations certainly tell a data-driven story. Since no visual trips are coming from Staten Island, it may help to viewer understand what's going on a bit more if zoomed in on just Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. That way, you could more clearly see the common routes and hotspots. If zoomed in, it would also be easier to see the faint lines that originate in south Brooklyn, a route that I'm particularly curious about. Great graph! I'm very impressed with anything geopandas-related. :)
