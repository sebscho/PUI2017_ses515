# HW 9: Review of Matt Dwyer's Tree Plot

![tree plot](https://github.com/sebscho/PUI2017_ses515/blob/master/HW9_ses515/Tree_plot_matt.png)
#### **Figure 1.** The distribution of tree diameters categorized by tree health. All three types of health seem to follow the same general trend in distributions of diameters.

## Review: 

This plot is clear, simple, and easy to read. The colors make sense with what's being conveyed; they add to the meaning of the plot. While it's clear to me what the labels are, it does appear that the distributions of trees in good health and in fair health are very different. One opportunity may be to visualize these differences further, perhaps with fit lines, or by normalizing. Overall the plot does tell a story: younger trees, with smaller diameters, tend to be healthier. This is a clear, honest, and beautiful way to make that clear. I would also be intersted if the health of trees by borough would tell another data driven story. Well done!
